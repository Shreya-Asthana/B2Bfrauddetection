# B2Bfrauddetection


In this project, I developed a comprehensive data processing pipeline that integrates various data sources, including:

- `Courier Rates`: Analyzed fixed and additional shipping costs across different delivery zones.
- `Invoices`: Managed shipment details, including weights and billing amounts.
- `Order Reports`: Tracked product demand and inventory through SKU management.
- `Pincodes`: Mapped delivery areas to ensure efficient logistics.
By merging and analyzing this data, I was able to calculate expected charges based on weight slabs and delivery zones, providing valuable insights for better decision-making in shipping operations.

This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in detecting fraudulent activities in B2B transactions. By integrating and analyzing various data sources, we can identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraud, helping to enhance operational efficiency and improve customer satisfaction in the logistics industry.
