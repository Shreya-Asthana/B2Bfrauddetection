In this project, I developed a comprehensive data processing pipeline that integrates various data sources, including:

- `Courier Rates`: Analyzed fixed and additional shipping costs across different delivery zones.
- `Invoices`: Managed shipment details, including weights and billing amounts.
- `Order Reports`: Tracked product demand and inventory through SKU management.
- `Pincodes`: Mapped delivery areas to ensure efficient logistics.
By merging and analyzing this data, I was able to calculate expected charges based on weight slabs and delivery zones, providing valuable insights for better decision-making in shipping operations.

This project showcases the power of data in enhancing operational efficiency and improving customer satisfaction in the logistics industry.
